# Quadtree Image Compression

A simple C++ tool for compressing images using a quadtree structure. Uses OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- Compress images by splitting regions based on color variance
- Save compressed images as .qtc files
- Load and view compressed .qtc files
- Adjustable compression threshold

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- OpenCV 4.x
- CMake 3.10+

## Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

### Compress an image
```bash
./quadtree_compression --compress <image_path> [threshold]
```
- `<image_path>`: Path to the input image (e.g., `../tests/images/flower.png`)
- `[threshold]`: (Optional) Color variance threshold (default: 10)

This creates a compressed image (`*_compressed.png`) and a `.qtc` file in the same directory.

### Load and view a compressed file
```bash
./quadtree_compression --load <qtc_path>
```
- `<qtc_path>`: Path to a `.qtc` file generated by the compressor

A window will display the decompressed image.

## How it works

- The image is recursively split into quadrants if color variance is above the threshold.
- Each leaf node is filled with the average color of its region.
- The compressed structure can be saved and loaded using the `.qtc` format.
